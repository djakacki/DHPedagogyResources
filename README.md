# DHPedagogyResources
A sharable resource for scripts, toolkits, and readings for people interested in Digital Humanities Pedagogy. I have added attribution in the code and stripped out any student-specific information so please feel free to use the materials. 

Since many of the materials have been developed with assistance of others, I encourage you to pass on any recognition to those who have worked before.

Please tweet me with questions: @DianeJakacki
