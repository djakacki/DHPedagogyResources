# DHPedagogyResources
A sharable resource for scripts, toolkits, and readings for people interested in Digital Humanities Pedagogy.  

In hopes of recognizing so many of the people writing and engaged in pedagogical subjects (and who often do this work in the shadows),  feel free to share that attribution.
